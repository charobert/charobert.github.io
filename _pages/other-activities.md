Throughout my Ph.D., I have been eager to go beyond the traditional academic track and explore professional environments where data directly informs policy and decision-making. My goal has been to gain first-hand experience in how research and data translate into practice, and build expertise across different contexts and settings. This led me to pursue different positions in national and international organizations, which at their core involved working with inspiring colleagues from diverse backgrounds. These experiences were a chance to discover how rewarding it is to collaborate across disciplines, work as a team, and contribute to shared goals.
