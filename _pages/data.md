Based on the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS), the Geocoded Official Development Assistance Dataset (GODAD) provides geo-localized information on aid projects from 18 European donors and the United States for the 1973-2020 period. We geo-locate CRS data via a natural language processing approach and provide auxiliary information about projects along several dimensions, including donor and recipient countries, donor agencies, flow type (grants, loans, other official flows), sectors and sub-sectors of aid, and commitment and disbursement amounts. We also include data on aid projects from China (2000-2021), India (2007-2014), and the World Bank (1995-2023).

The Political Leaders’ Affiliation Database (PLAD) is compiled manually. It includes a wealth of leader-related data, including geocoded information on the birthplace and ethnicity of political leaders. We collected this information by structured internet searches. As sources, we mainly rely on online libraries and databases such as CIA World Factbook, Munzinger, Encyclopaedia Britannica, and Ethnicity of Celebs, as well as on reports from news services such as BBC News, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. PLAD also includes information on leaders’ tenure and education and in part draws on existing data collection efforts. Please cite the original sources of all data, as we indicate in the codebook below.
