**Abstract:**  
This paper explores the informal influence of political leaders' spouses on the subnational allocation and effectiveness of development aid. We investigate whether regions containing the birthplaces of political leaders' spouses receive significantly more aid during their partners' tenure and whether this aid is less effective compared to other times. To examine these patterns, we construct two new global datasets: one tracking the personal characteristics of political leaders and their spouses, and another geocoding aid projects, including new data on aid from the United States and 18 European donors. Our analysis of the 1990-2020 period reveals that regions with the birthplaces of political leaders' spouses receive significantly more aid from Western bilateral donors, while political favoritism through Chinese aid shifts from the birth regions of spouses to those of the leaders themselves. We find that aid to the birth regions of spouses increases particularly before elections and is less effective there compared to aid given to the same regions at other times.

**Abstract:**  
The lack of comparable urban definitions across countries has presented a significant challenge in effectively addressing poverty in both urban and rural areas. This study aims to tackle this issue by comparing subnational poverty statistics across countries, integrating internationally consistent definitions of urban areas into the World Bankâ€™s official global poverty measurement framework. Focusing primarily on 16 Sub-Saharan African countries, the analysis reveals that poverty rates tend to be lower in densely populated urban areas. However, the findings also highlight that urban areas have a higher concentration of impoverished populations than previously estimated. These results underscore the importance of employing consistent urban definitions in cross-country poverty analysis and call for a reevaluation of geographically targeted policies to expedite poverty reduction efforts.
